object-oriented programming technique, we design a program using objects
 and classes.</p>
<p>An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only. </p>

<h3 class="h2">What is an object in Java</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/objects.jpg" alt="object in Java" width="350" height="350" style="margin-left:20px;float:right;">
<p>An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., 
chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical
 (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the 
banking system.
</p>
<p>An object has three characteristics:</p>
<ul class="points"><li><strong>State:</strong> represents the data (value) of an object.</li><li><strong>Behavior:</strong> represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.</li><li><strong>Identity:</strong> An object identity is typically 
implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the 
external user. However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify 
each object uniquely.</li></ul>

<p>For Example, Pen is an object. Its name is Reynolds; color is white, 
known as its state. It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.
</p>
<p><strong>An object is an instance of a class.</strong> A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.
</p>
<p><strong>Object Definitions:</strong></p>
<ul class="points"><li>An object is <em>a real-world entity</em>.</li><li>An object is <em>a runtime entity</em>.</li><li>The object is <em>an entity which has state and behavior</em>.</li><li>The object is <em>an instance of a class</em>.</li></ul></div>
