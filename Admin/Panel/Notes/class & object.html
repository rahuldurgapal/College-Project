object-oriented programming technique, we design a program using objects
 and classes.</p>
<p>An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only. </p>
<a id="object"></a>
<h3 class="h2">What is an object in Java</h3>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/objects.jpg" alt="object in Java" width="350" height="350" style="margin-left:20px;float:right;">
<p>An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., 
chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical
 (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the 
banking system.
</p>
<p>An object has three characteristics:</p>
<ul class="points"><li><strong>State:</strong> represents the data (value) of an object.</li><li><strong>Behavior:</strong> represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.</li><li><strong>Identity:</strong> An object identity is typically 
implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the 
external user. However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify 
each object uniquely.</li></ul>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/characteristics-of-object.jpg" alt="Characteristics of Object in Java">
<p>For Example, Pen is an object. Its name is Reynolds; color is white, 
known as its state. It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.
</p>
<p><strong>An object is an instance of a class.</strong> A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.
</p>
<p><strong>Object Definitions:</strong></p>
<ul class="points"><li>An object is <em>a real-world entity</em>.</li><li>An object is <em>a runtime entity</em>.</li><li>The object is <em>an entity which has state and behavior</em>.</li><li>The object is <em>an instance of a class</em>.</li></ul>

<h2 id="class" class="h2">What is a class in Java</h2>
<p>A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a 
template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical 
entity. It can't be physical.</p>
<p>A class in Java can contain:</p>
<ul class="points"><li><strong>Fields</strong></li><li><strong>Methods</strong></li><li><strong>Constructors</strong></li><li><strong>Blocks</strong></li><li><strong>Nested class and interface</strong></li></ul>

<h3 class="h4">Syntax to declare a class:</h3>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="dp-highlighter"><div class="bar"><div class="tools"><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java#"></a><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java#"></a><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java#"></a></div></div><ol start="1" class="dp-j"><li class="alt"><span><span class="keyword">class</span><span>&nbsp;&lt;class_name&gt;{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li><li class=""><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li class="alt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li class=""><span>}&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ol></div></div>
<hr>
<a id="objectinstancevariable"></a>
<h3 class="h2">Instance variable in Java</h3>
<p>A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method 
is known as an instance variable. Instance variable doesn't get memory 
at compile time. It gets memory at runtime when an object or instance is
 created. That is why it is known as an instance variable.</p>
<hr>
<a id="objectmethod"></a>
<h3 class="h2">Method in Java</h3>
<p>In Java, a method is like a function which is used to expose the behavior of an object.</p>
<a id="objectadvantageofmethod"></a>
<h4 class="h4">Advantage of Method</h4>
<ul class="points"><li>Code Reusability</li><li>Code Optimization</li></ul>
<hr>
<a id="objectnewkeyword"></a>
<h3 class="h2">new keyword in Java</h3>
<p>The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. All objects get memory in Heap memory area.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3ex">Object and Class Example: main within the class</h3>
<p>In this example, we have created a Student class which has two data 
members id and name. We are creating the object of the Student class by 
new keyword and printing the object's value.</p></div>
