            <p>In Java, classes and objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented 
Programming (OOPs) that are used to represent real-world concepts and 
entities. The class represents a group of objects having similar 
properties and behavior. For example, the animal type <strong>Dog</strong> is a class while a particular dog named <strong>Tommy </strong>is an object of the <strong>Dog</strong> class.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss Java objects and classes and how to implement them in our program.</p>
