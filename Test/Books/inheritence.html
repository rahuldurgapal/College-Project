            <p style="text-align:justify">The capability of a <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-classes-and-objects/">class </a>to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called <strong>Inheritance</strong>. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify">Inheritance
 is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the 
existing classes. The new class created is called “derived class” or 
“child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or 
“parent class”. The derived class now is said to be inherited from the 
base class.</p><div id="GFG_AD_gfg_mobile_336x280"></div><p style="text-align:justify">When
 we say derived class inherits the base class, it means, the derived 
class inherits all the properties of the base class, without changing 
the properties of base class and may add new features to its own. These 
new features in the derived class will not affect the base class. The 
derived class is the specialized class for the base class.</p>
